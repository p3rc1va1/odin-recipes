        My mother was one of the best cooks I ever knew. Whenever she made stews we mostly found homemade dumplings in them.<br>
        We never ate things from packages or microwaves and you sure could taste what food was. That's the only way I cook today<br>
        â€” I don't use any electronic gadgets to cook with except an electric stove.
